## About Us
A Wikia Techno Services is founded by HM100 in 2018. Since then, projects are actively managed (Some were in the past but not any longer). Some contributons from others has happened as well. The personal community wiki can be found [here](https://alpha-technologies.fandom.com/el) while [here](https://alphafoundation.fandom.com/el) you can find out the foundation wiki. These wikis are hybrid Greek-English which put emphasis to what this organization will do.
